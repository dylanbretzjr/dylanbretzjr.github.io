I confirmed that Chicago observed DST and that the clocks turned back 1 hour at 2 a.m. on 2024-11-03, which coincided with the negative-duration rides in the dataset.\nWhile there were only 43 rides with negative durations, I couldn’t simply drop them since there were likely other rows affected by the DST time shift.\nBasically, if a ride occurred during the fall time shift window, the calculated ride duration would be 1 hour less than it actually was, causing rides shorter than 1 hour to be negative. And if a ride occurred during the spring time shift window, the calculated ride duration would be 1 hour more than it actually was.\nIn total, 507 rows (0.01%) were affected by DST—476 in the fall and 31 in the spring. Since so few rows were affected, I dropped them with negligible impact on the findings.\nWhile it also would have been possible to adjust the timestamps and correct these rows, dropping them was the simplest and cleanest approach for this case study, especially considering the negligible loss of data."

Neither extreme would likely represent valid trips.\nTo better understand this, I plotted the distribution of ride lengths.\nFull Distribution of Ride Duration:\n\nThe vast majority of rides lasted 1 hour or less.\nHowever, the distribution showed a long right tail of unusually lengthy rides. To make this tail more apparent, I plotted ride frequency on a logarithmic scale.\nFull Distribution of Ride Duration (Log Scale):\n\nOverall, the distribution is heavily right-skewed, with most rides concentrated at shorter durations.\nTo take a closer look at this concentration, I zoomed in on rides under 1 hour.\nDistribution of Ride Duration Under 1 Hour:\n\nAt this scale, there is a noticeable spike in very short rides, with an unusually high count lasting 1 minute or less.\nTo examine this more closely, I zoomed in further to rides under 5 minutes.\nDistribution of Ride Duration Under 5 Minutes:\n\nThis revealed an especially high concentration of rides lasting 30 seconds or less.\nI suspected that the unusually high frequency of extremely short rides may have been caused by false starts (undocking and quickly re-docking a bike in favor of another) or canceled rides. Extremely long rides, on the other hand, may have been caused by docking errors or forgotten rides.\nSince both extremely short and extremely long rides likely do not represent typical rider behavior, I dropped all rides lasting 1 minute or less and all rides lasting 1 day or more.\n142,855 rides lasting 1 minute or less and 207 rides lasting 1 day or more were removed for a total of 143,062 rows, representing 2.57% of the original combined dataset."

I exported it to HTML with custom JavaScript that links the pan and zoom of the maps and adds responsive scaling for different screen sizes.\nRide Locations by Membership Status:\n\n\nMember ride locations are more dispersed, while casual riders tend to cluster near the lakeshore\n\nThe map can be accessed here.\nBecause the map is interactive, you can pan and zoom around to view specific areas."
